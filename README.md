# summer_of_bitcoin_challenge

This is my solution to the Summer of Bitcoin 2021 Challenge. 

## Instructions

- `sb_README.pdf` contains the problem statement. 
- `code.py` contains the solution to the problem which creates `block.txt`. 
- `mempool.csv` contains the mempool of transactions. 
- `block.txt` contains the final block of transactions. 
- `stats.txt` contains the stats of the final block (total fee, total weight and size of block). 
- `check.py` checks if `block.txt` follows the constraints of the problem. 
- `block_sample.txt` contains a sample non-working block.
